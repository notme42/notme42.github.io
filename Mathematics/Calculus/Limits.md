###### Be aware *this is a work in progress*
###### I'm 99% confident that these formulas are correct, &nbsp;but if they aren't and you use them and get something wrong it's not my fault, &nbsp;you're the one who chose to use this.
###### I'm working on a table of contents so you can get to what you want to see faster

###### Key:
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;`c`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a constant. &nbsp;not an equation. &nbsp;not some formula dependant on x. &nbsp;just good old fashioned x.
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;`x`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just x. &nbsp;plain old x.
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;`u` / `k`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an expression. &nbsp;basically a function, &nbsp;except without the parenthesis. &nbsp;derivative is noted by `u'`
###### `f(x)` / `g(x)`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrary functions of x. &nbsp;derivative can be noted as `f'(x)` or `d/dx [ f(x) ]`
